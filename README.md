# Web Automation Selenium

This project was created for learning automation using `selenium`. I've also included some methods that u can use.

#### `log_navigate_make_list(name_of_board="mwehehe", list_name="Todo", card_content="Make Regsiter Page")`

This method handles logging in, navigating to the board, making a list, adding a card, and returning to the dashboard. 

Parameter:

- `name_of_board` = The name of your board
- `list_name` = The name of list u want to create
- `card_content` = Content of the card
