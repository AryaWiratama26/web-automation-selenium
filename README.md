# Web Automation Selenium

This project was created for learning automation using `selenium`. I've also included some methods that u can use.

##### 1. `log_navigate_make_list_add_card(name_of_board="love", list_name="Todo", card_content="Make Regsiter Page")`

This method handles logging in, navigating to the board, making a list, adding a card, and returning to the dashboard. 

Parameter:

- `name_of_board` = The name of your board
- `list_name` = The name of list u want to create
- `card_content` = Content of the card

##### 2. `bot_satu.log_make_board_make_list_add_card(board_name="Mami", list_name="Too do", card_content="Backend API")`

This method handle logging in, make board, making list, adding a card, dan returning to the bashboard.

Paramater:
- `board_name` = The name of your board u want to create
- `list_name` = The name of list u want to create
- `card_content` = Content of the card

Thank u. Maybe i'll update this code
